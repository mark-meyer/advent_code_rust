# Advent of Code 2021

### Rust

To install compiler and cargo: [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Running
To do a quick build and run just `cd` to the directory and use cargo:

```
> cd one
> cargo run

solution one: 2272262
solution two: 2134882034
```

run tests the same way:

```
> cd two
>cargo test

running 2 tests
test test::p_one ... ok
test test::p_two ... ok
test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```
